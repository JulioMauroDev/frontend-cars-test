## Code patterns and tech used

I tried to complete this challenge with the technologies and patterns that I work with usually. The libraries and patterns that I used for this project are overkill for a project so small but I thought would be a great idea to show how I usually work.
An example of this was the usage of sagas or even redux, using context would be more than necessary.

As you can see I follow a container pattern to manage the state of the application, those containers wrap the pages and all actions and logic would be available on those pages.


## Thanks!
If you have any questions or problems running the app locally please let me know.
